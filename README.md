# PXCore
Creating a multiplatform game engine written in C/C++, originally inspried by the game engine I wrote in Objective C to run the first available version of Super Plexis on the App Store.
Desired platforms are iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Until this project becomes more important to the public scope, I won't be working on it all of the time. Currently this is more of a side project than anything, so even the documentation is lacking.
